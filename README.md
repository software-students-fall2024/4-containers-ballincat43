# Ballin Speech Analyzer

## Description

Our project is a speech analyzer that recieves microphone or audio file input, converts it to text, then computes various data from it, including a variety score, most common word, longest word, and more, allowing the user to see how they might improve their speech. Users can also compare with the statistics of everyone who has used the app.
